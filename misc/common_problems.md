## Max-sum or 3-sum blitz

Variants:

* Find max sum
* Find if two values are equal to k
* Find k-largest

### If not sorted

1. Keep invariant x > y  [k = 2]
2. Interactively find first max, then find another one [k = 2]
3. Randomized selection (k-largest)
4. Heap

### If sorted

Binary search from both ends [k = 2]

### 3-sum

If three-sum, find two-sum and find the difference between v and two-sum
