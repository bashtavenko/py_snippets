CAP THEOREM

Consistency - a read is guaranteed to return the most recent write for a given
client.

Availability - a non-failing node will return a reasonable response withing a
reasonable amount of time (no error or timeout).

Partition Tolerance - the system will continue to function when network
partition occurs.


CP - Consistency / Partition Tolerance. Could get timeout or an error.
AP - Availability / Partition Tolerance. Could get stale data. Accept writes that
can be processed later.
